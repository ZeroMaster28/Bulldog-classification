This is project for machine learning classes. Subject is quite simple. Using so called transfer learning and already pre-trained model we want to create new model that works with more sophisticated data, bulldog breed type in that case. Using params.py let us easily define
different models with more complex categories (bulldogs are just an example).

Backend is based on Tensorflow and Keras due to kaggle intorduction to deep learning.
